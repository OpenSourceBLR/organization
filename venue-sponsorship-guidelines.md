**Venue Sponsorship Guidelines**

In any conversation with any 'potential' venue sponsor, we must insist on the following:

What we NEED

*  Space for 60 people
*  LCD projector (VGA/HDMI)
*  Power outlets
*  Access to Washroom
*  Drinking water

what we DON'T NEED

*  Snacks
*  Goodies
*  Bureacracy
*  WiFi
*  Food

The GOAL is TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE and not picnic.

By keeping the FOCUS on the GOAL of the meetup, we show more RESULTs in 4 hours than any other class or mode of interaction by anybody.

By setting this expectation with the Venue Sponsor and the meetup Attendee, right in the beginning, there are no surprises or cost structures to deal with.

This also helps us improve our preparedness both as community stewards and as organizers of multiple workshops.
