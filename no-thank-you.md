## No Thank you

In as much we are thankful to the venue sponsor's towards co-ordination with organizing Open Source community events, we are cognizant of any unpleasant experience at a venue.

We believe, the manner of interaction of the security or support staff flows straight from the attitude of the organization.

During the March 11, 2017 Golang meetup at Google RMZ office, the attendees had a very unpleasant experience.

We'd like to exercise abundant caution, with any suggestions towards organizing any Open Source Community event at Google office.
